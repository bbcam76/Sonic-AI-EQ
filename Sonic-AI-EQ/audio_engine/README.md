# Sonic AI EQ - Audio Engine Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the audio engine component of the Sonic AI EQ project. The audio engine is responsible for applying digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and equalization (EQ) adjustments to audio files.

## Overview

The audio engine is designed to work seamlessly with the backend and AI model components of the Sonic AI EQ project. It processes audio data to enhance sound quality based on AI-generated EQ settings.

## Directory Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the audio engine.
  - **dsp.py**: Implements digital signal processing functions and classes.
  - **eq.py**: Contains functions and classes for applying equalization to audio signals.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies for the audio engine, navigate to the `audio_engine` directory and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The audio engine can be utilized by importing the necessary modules in the backend application. For example:

```python
from audio_engine.src.dsp import DSP
from audio_engine.src.eq import Equalizer
```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional DSP algorithms for more advanced audio processing.
- Optimize performance for real-time audio processing.
- Integrate user feedback mechanisms to refine EQ settings based on listener preferences.

## Contributing

Contributions to the audio engine are welcome! Please follow the project's contribution guidelines for submitting changes or enhancements.
