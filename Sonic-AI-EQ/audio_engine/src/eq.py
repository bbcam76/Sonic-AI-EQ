# Equalization Processing Module

This module provides functions and classes for applying equalization to audio signals. It includes methods for setting up equalizer bands, applying gains, and processing audio data.

class Equalizer:
    def __init__(self, bands):
        self.bands = bands  # List of frequency bands
        self.gains = [0] * len(bands)  # Initialize gains for each band

    def set_gain(self, band_index, gain):
        """Set the gain for a specific frequency band."""
        if 0 <= band_index < len(self.bands):
            self.gains[band_index] = gain
        else:
            raise IndexError("Band index out of range.")

    def apply_eq(self, audio_signal):
        """Apply equalization to the given audio signal."""
        # Placeholder for applying EQ to the audio signal
        # This should involve DSP techniques to adjust the audio signal based on self.gains
        processed_signal = audio_signal  # Replace with actual processing logic
        return processed_signal

def band_split(audio_signal, bands):
    """Split the audio signal into specified frequency bands."""
    # Placeholder for band splitting logic
    # This function should return the audio signal split into the defined bands
    return [audio_signal] * len(bands)  # Replace with actual splitting logic

def combine_bands(band_signals):
    """Combine processed band signals back into a single audio signal."""
    # Placeholder for combining band signals
    # This function should return the combined audio signal
    return sum(band_signals)  # Replace with actual combining logic
