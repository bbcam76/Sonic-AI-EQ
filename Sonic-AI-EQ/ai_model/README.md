# Sonic AI Model

This directory contains the implementation details and documentation for the AI model used in the Sonic AI EQ project.

## Overview

The AI model is designed to analyze audio data and predict optimal equalization settings. It leverages deep learning techniques to process audio features and generate EQ adjustments.

## Directory Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used for training the AI model.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis related to the AI model.
- **src/**: Source code for the AI model.
  - **model.py**: Defines the architecture of the AI model.
  - **train.py**: Contains the training logic for the AI model.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the AI model.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `ai_model` directory and install the required packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the datasets are placed in the `data/` directory.

3. **Training the Model**: Run the training script to start training the AI model:
   ```
   python src/train.py
   ```

4. **Experimentation**: Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for analysis and experimentation with the model.
