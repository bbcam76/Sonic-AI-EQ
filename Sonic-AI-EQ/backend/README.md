# Sonic AI EQ Backend Documentation

## Overview
The backend of the Sonic AI EQ project is responsible for handling audio processing, AI inference, and storage. It serves as the bridge between the frontend user interface and the AI model, ensuring that user requests are processed efficiently and accurately.

## Structure
The backend is organized into several key components:

- **API**: Contains the endpoints for handling requests from the frontend.
- **Models**: Defines the data structures used throughout the application.
- **Services**: Implements the business logic and data processing functionalities.
- **Main Application**: The entry point for the backend application, setting up the server and routing.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Sonic-AI-EQ/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   Start the backend server:
   ```
   python app/main.py
   ```

4. **API Endpoints**
   The backend exposes several API endpoints for the frontend to interact with. Refer to the API documentation in the `app/api` directory for details on available endpoints and their usage.

## Development
- Use the `app/models` directory to define new data models as needed.
- Implement business logic in the `app/services` directory.
- Add new API endpoints in the `app/api` directory.

## Testing
Ensure to write tests for your services and API endpoints to maintain code quality. Tests can be placed in a dedicated `tests` directory within the `app` folder.
